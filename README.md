# Scrabble-Bot #
Welcome to my project of creating a bot, that will be your opponent in the game of Scrabble.
---
### Build your own 
In case you would like to build you own SB (*Scrabble-Bot*), you can find the source-code and specifications under`/main`. You will also need a 3D printer and lots of patience and time. I will add the 3D models eventually, once I get them to a usable state.

Don't be affraid to reach out.

### Virtual SB ### 
You can use the virtual version of SB located under `/virtual/v_scrabble.py`

---
### Play
The playing seqence of SB:
1. place your move and press a continue button
2. get the image from the camera on top
3. using AI transform this image to letters
4. use my dictonary and scoring algorithm to find the best move
5. move selected tiles with the pysical hand to build the word
